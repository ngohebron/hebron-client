    title: "How We Raised 34K",
    desc: `When rising food prices left daily-wage families struggling even for basic meals, we decided that waiting was not an option. 
    Our volunteers came together across different districts, spreading the word through social media, local communities, and personal networks. 
    Small contributions started coming in—₹20, ₹50, and ₹100—proving that impact doesn’t depend on how much you give, but how many hearts unite.
    Within just 10 days, we managed to raise ₹34,000, enough to provide ration kits to multiple families in need.
    Each ration kit contained essentials like rice, wheat, oil, lentils, and spices that could support a family for weeks.
    The happiness and relief in their eyes reminded us why humanity always wins.
    This initiative not only fed hungry families but also restored hope, dignity, and the belief that society still stands together in times of crisis.
    What started as a small idea turned into a wave of kindness we will always be proud of.`,

    title: "Every Child Deserves a School",
    desc: `Education is not a privilege — it is a fundamental right, yet thousands of children in rural areas walk into a future filled with uncertainty.
    Many of them dream of studying, but poverty, lack of school supplies, and absence of parental awareness become huge barriers.
    We identified children struggling due to the lack of basic learning materials like notebooks, pencils, school bags, uniforms, and shoes.
    With the help of donors and volunteers, we distributed school kits and encouraged parents to continue their children's education.
    The smiles on their faces and the excitement to attend school proved that a small gesture can create a lifetime of opportunities.
    These children are not just students; they are future doctors, teachers, engineers, and leaders.
    Our mission is to ensure that no child drops out because of financial limitations.
    We strongly believe that when you educate a child, you uplift an entire generation.`,

    title: "The Blanket Drive That Warmed Hearts",
    desc: `Winter can be harsh—but it becomes unbearable for those who sleep without shelter, warm clothing, or blankets.
    When temperatures dropped, our team initiated a blanket donation drive to support vulnerable individuals and needy families.
    With collective efforts, we successfully distributed more than 700 blankets across rural and slum areas.
    Many elderly people, small children, and homeless individuals received a warm blanket that protected them during cold nights.
    Some had tears in their eyes because it was the only warm cover they had in years.
    It wasn’t just a blanket — it was comfort, hope, and a reminder that they are not forgotten.
    We learned that kindness has no season, and compassion requires no reason.
    The warmth we provided didn’t just shield bodies, but touched hearts forever.`,

    title: "Bringing Health to Their Doorstep",
    desc: `Many remote villages still lack basic access to medical facilities, forcing people to travel miles even for simple treatment.
    To address this, we organized mobile medical camps staffed by doctors, nurses, and trained volunteers.
    Over 500 families received health checkups, medicines, awareness sessions, and hygiene education.
    We focused especially on women, children, and the elderly who typically avoid or delay treatment due to cost or distance.
    The camp included blood pressure checks, diabetes screening, anemia testing, nutrition guidance, and free medication distribution.
    Many undiagnosed health issues were identified, preventing serious outcomes in the future.
    Our goal was not just treatment, but prevention and awareness.
    Health is a basic right — and until every village receives it, our mission continues.`,
